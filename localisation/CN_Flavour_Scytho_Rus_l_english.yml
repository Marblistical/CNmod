 scy_flavor.1.title:0 "Administrating the Finnic Pagans"
 scy_flavor.1.desc:0 "The Finnic peoples of Scythia are mostly pagans, and both Sunni hardliners and Orthodox Christian leaders demand they be converted. Currently, they have the same rights as people of the book but there is no theological justification for this. These pagans understand that continuing to worship their idols will cause future troubles. Despite this, they have totally rejected all conversion attempts by both Muslims and Christians.\n\nThe conversion of these pagans may seem insignificant but it sets a precedent for all future religious issues. If they are converted to Islam, the Orthodox population will begin to worry about their own precarious position. If they are converted to Christianity, all across the Khaganate would curse the Khagan as an infidel and a bastard.\n\nWe have recently built a regional capital in the heart of pagan lands. Now that we have control over the north, we can no longer ignore this issue."
 scy_flavor.1.a:0 "We must do the unthinkable and make a theological defense of paganism!"
 scy_flavor.1.b:0 "By giving the Finnics their own Khanates, we can legitimize their religion through the law."
 scy_flavor.1.c:0 "Let's break the false idols and raise the Finnics to civilisation by force!"

 scy_flavor.2.title:0 "Peoples Without Books"
 scy_flavor.2.desc:0 "The Finnic faiths are thoroughly pagan, with shamans, false idols and icons. On the surface, it seems impossible to be able to label their followers as being an equal to people of the book, a term mostly for astray monotheists like Jews or Christians. However, as long as these faiths have scriptures, a case can be made that they originate from the truths given by a prophet or prophets, distorted over time.\n\nUnfortunately, there does not exist a tradition of writing in any of the Finnic languages of Scythia. Even in Bjarmaland, administrators and merchants use foreign languages in writing. Although the different peoples all have rich oral histories and folklore which could pass as scripture, none of it can be written down without a writing system.\n\nUkonusko, the largest Finnic faith in Scythia, will be the focus of our initial attempts to document the Finnic faiths. The Komi language is used by most followers of Ukko within our direct borders and so will be the language used to document Ukonusko. There are various different scripts that we could use for Komi. Arabic is the most prestigious choice, but has little adoption amongst locals and will need to be heavily modified. Cyrillic is unpopular amongst the conservative Ulema, though there exists a small group of Christian Komi who use Cyrillic already to write in Komi. A third option would be to commission a new script for Komi and all Finnic languages broadly. This would take considerable effort but would be the most suited for common use."
 scy_flavor.2.a:0 "Beautiful ideas need beautiful writing; Arabic is the only choice."
 scy_flavor.2.b:0 "The Cyrillic script is already somewhat spread amongst the Komi. We should use it."
 scy_flavor.2.c:0 "If we want authentic documentation of the Finnic faiths, we need a Finnic script!"

 scy_flavor.3.title:0 "For All Peoples a Book"
 scy_flavor.3.desc:0 "A year after the beginning of the project, hundreds of Komi Ukonusko stories, oral histories and rituals have been compiled into 5 books. The rituals have been written down into two books divided on regional differences, whilst the history of the Komi people makes up one book. The main bulk of the writing up process was in transferring various songs and sagas into two massive books, all of which varied depending on which shaman was asked. The compilation of the 5 books has brought prestige to Ukonusko in the eyes of outsiders, though the vast majority of Komi themselves are illiterate and so cannot appreciate the effort.\n\nWhat they can appreciate though is the new rights they have been given based on the existence of the 5 books. Now that there is a solid set of scripture, sympathetic theologians can and have written long defenses of the validity of faith in Ukko. By using Komi history and selective references to legendary shamans in sagas, these scholars argue that the Komi people were given a prophet by Allah (as according to the Surah 10.47) and over millenia were led astray, just as the Christians and Jews were.\n\nScholars from madrasas as far as Ukek have taken inspiration from the project and have begun their own research on the Finnic faiths. Bjarmians, Meryans and even the Mari have all benefitted as much as the Komi, with their scriptures being written down and compiled by Muslim scholars interested in the newly emerging science of comparing religions and histories. Interestingly, or alarmingly to some, the ancient faith of Tengrism as well as other non-Finnic pagan religions have been subject to the same research efforts."
