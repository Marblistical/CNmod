 BJA_lineage_of_two_gods_desc:0 "The Bjarmian nation is one dominated by two Gods: the native Uko and the honorary Allah. While there are other, lesser gods in the pantheon, it is undeniable that the Green Bolt has become the religious embodiment of the Bjarmian spirit."

 CSH_divide_land_abolish_grain_taxes_desc:0 "The Shun had its beginnings in a peasant rebellion, and our base of support has always been the peasants. To keep their favour we must redistribute agricultural land and abolish the grain taxes payment system."
 CSH_killing_cattle_opening_gates:0 "Kill Cattle and Open the City Gates"
 CSH_killing_cattle_opening_gates_desc:0 "Our programs of land reform have resulted in a strongly favourable attitude from China's peasantry towards us. Wherever the Shun Army marches, the people slaughter their cattle and open the gates of their cities for our soldiers."

 CSH_rise_of_the_dashing_king_desc:0 "Li Zicheng, also known as the 'Dashing King,' is a charismatic military commander who has widespread support among the peasants for his policy of aiding the poor and only attacking enemy officials and their armies. By making use of his reputation, he will be of great aid in our conquest of China."
 CSH_nestorian_influence:0 "Metropolitanate of Lanzhou"
 CSH_nestorian_influence_desc:0 "The Nestorian Christian Church in Xibei has a complicated relationship with our government. Though many see it as an extension of the Western Liao spreading the Khitan's influence into Xibei, there are undeniable benefits to cooperating with the church. In exchange for us tolerating their presence in Xibei, they have been providing us with invaluable intelligence about our enemies."
 CSH_gao_guiying:0 "Gao Guiying"
 CSH_gao_guiying_desc:0 "Gao Guiying, the wife of Li Zicheng, has raised and trained the female troops within our army with great effectiveness. Though female military commanders are exceptionally rare in China, Gao has more than proven her worth to the Shun."
 CSH_fight_famine_rebuild_country:0 "Combat Famine and Rebuild the Country"
 CSH_fight_famine_rebuild_country_desc:0 "It was famine and disease that allowed the Shun to rise. The stability of every dynasty depends on the peasantry, and to make sure that we do not fall into the same trap as so many before us, we must work to make sure that wide-spread famines become a thing of the past in China."

 LIA_gunpowder_empire:0 "The Gunpowder Empire"
 LIA_gunpowder_empire_desc:0 "Rifles, cannons, rockets, mines: the Liao Arsenal has become filled with weapons of gunpowder.\nThe wars in Europe have made the power of firearms and artillery obvious for all to see, and yet, many states still continue to cling on to ancient ways of war. Let their failure be our advantage, the Liao will become experts in the ways of modern warfare."
 LIA_silk_crossroads:0 "Silk Crossroads"
 LIA_silk_crossroads_desc:0 "The Silk Road has rarely ever been so prosperous. Our campaigns of conquest and pacification have revitalized the old trans-Eurasian trade routes between the steppes, Arabia, India and China, and as the middlemen in these mercantile arrangements, we are able to command a great deal of influence in the realm of trade."
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire:0 "Bureaucratic Empire"
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire_desc:0 "The heart of the Liao has always been its bureaucracy. It is this administrative monster that keeps our incredibly diverse and vast realm united and running smoothly in the face of rebellion, famine, chaos and war. As long as the bureaucracy keeps running, so does the Great Liao."
 LIA_economic_planning:0 "Economic Planning"
 LIA_economic_planning_desc:0 "The state does not bend to greedy merchants and bankers. Though they may claim that the economy is best left to those who know it as well as they do, we cannot trust them to always make the best decision for the Empire. The government must take a more active role in ensuring prosperity for it's myriad subjects, starting in the realm of economics."
 LIA_imperial_reorganization:0 "Era of Imperial Reorganization"
 LIA_imperial_reorganization_desc:0 "The 'Era of Imperial Reorganization' was a time of great upheaval in the Empire. The once powerful Imperial Army had stagnated, while the long-standing policy of bureaucratic centralism had become less and less respected in the face of growing bureaucratic corruption. By 1773 however, Emperor Yelü Zhou had grown fed up with the complacency of imperial officials, and ordered that a grand purge of corrupt officials be conducted. Though initially many were suspicious, believing this to be a way of purging anti-imperial individuals, their worries were eventually proven wrong as Emperor Zhou increasingly began adopting many of the recommendations made.\n\nThough the Reformer-Emperor eventually passed in 1806, the Era of Imperial Reorganization continued. The finance and banking systems were overhauled and modernized, criminal and civil codes were updated, new ministries were established, homosexuality and several traditions previously considered 'barbarian' were legalized, an Imperial Citizenship was established, and much more."

Guarding the Frontier, holding until the last man: that is our duty to the Empire, and only in death does our duty end."
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory:0 "Restore the Observatory"
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory_desc:0 "There are many things humanity does not know about the operations of the stars and the sun, of the planets and the world. Though it may still be centuries until we can definitively know the answers to even a fraction of the questions that the stars hold, we can leave our mark on the road there by restoring the famous Samarqand Observatory, surely to become a place of great scientific advancements."
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand:0 "Bank of Samarqand"
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand_desc:0 "Samarqand has always lagged behind the rest of the Empire in economic terms. The region received less attention than most others from the Imperial Government, partially due to the awkward administrative arrangements surrounding the country. No more! Balashagun has at last established a government-backed moneylending institution with the expressed purpose of financing promising development projects in the region."
 SMR_liao_renaissance:0 "The Liao Renaissance"
 SMR_liao_renaissance_desc:0 "In few places is the Liao Renaissance more visible than in Samarqand. The influx of Persian and European scholars has brought about a golden age of culture and science, and we would be fools not to take advantage by hiring a few of these great minds."
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries:0 "Fuzhuda"
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries_desc:0 "Pacifying Persia in the aftermath of the Anxi Wars was never going to be easy. As the continued resistance began to take a toll on the Liao forces, they increasingly called upon soldiers from Samarqand to serve in the pacification campaign. Many of these men have returned home as experienced veterans, bringing a great benefit to our military capabilities."
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand:0 "Metropolitanate of Samarqand"
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand_desc:0 "The Nestorian Church has a complicated relationship with Samarqand. The majority of our population follows their faith, but rebellion would only bring about Imperial intervention. As such, both parties have mostly chosen to work with each other rather than to fight each other: the Nestorians are able to practice their religion with little restrictions, and in exchange we get to take advantage of the church's extensive connections in the Imperial Court and the christian communities all across the Middle East." 
 SMR_northern_capital:0 "The Northern Capital"
 SMR_northern_capital_desc:0 "Though the Liao's center of power eventually shifted out of Central Asia and into Mesopotamia, Samarqand's influence as a major trade city and popular vacation destination for Emperors remained. This arrangement of the city being an unofficial second capital was legitimized when the city was declared the northern capital of the Liao, and Samarqand (now 'Beijing') only continued to gain in renown afterwards."

 SUH_crab_fighting_desc:0 "Ready, Set, Go!!\n\nDue to the oppressive heat and lack of vast swathes of agricultural land, cock-fighting can't be supported as a sport in the vast majority of the nation, therefore to the beaches it is! Inspired by tales of giant crabs living on an island to the west, crab-fighting is a new sport, wherein the fiercest crabs with the biggest claws are made to fight in an enclosed ring. This new sport will spread across the Walythan Islands, and be enjoyed by all for generations to come!"
 SUH_el_diab:0 "Walbreieu el-Diab"
 SUH_el_diab_desc:0 "The name Walbreieu el-Diab is one that every Suhraltanubian will immediately recognize, for there have been few greater minds to ever inhabit this world. In a voyage funded by the Akgulid Caliph, el-Diab set out from the Red Sea for the Spice Islands and then his homeland of Suhraltanubia. From here, it was onwards further to the east and south through Polynesia and along a newly discovered coast which he rounding, ultimately crossing the straits of Gibraltar under the cover of darkness to finally arrive in Alexandria.\n\nHe will go down in the pages of history as a great explorer, as the first man to sail a fleet around the globe, and his example will inspire many Suhraltanubians even long after his death."

 SUH_polynesian_integration_desc:0 "The people of Walytha are diverse and distant from another, creating a vast array of unique traditions and cultures. To create a truly Walythan state, we must learn from, convert, and integrate all of them."

 SUH_marine_corps:0 "Suhraltanubian Marines"
 SUH_marine_corps_desc:0 "Fighting in Walytha is vastly different than in the great landmasses of Eurasia and Avalon. Land warfare plays second fiddle to the control of the seas. \n\nUnlike the continental powers, we have long adapted to this insular style of warfare. Not only are our regular soldiers faster at boarding and unboarding, we have also established the famous Suhraltanubian Marines, a corps of elite soldiers specializing in naval landings and insular warfare."

 SCY_rushing_army_desc:0 "The army of the Scythians is the rushing army, for it is how we have conquered such a swath of the steppe in the past and present. It is cavalry warfare which brought our dominance, and it is the cavalry that will expand it!"
 SCY_vassals:0 "Kharægat"
 SCY_vassals_desc:0 "The 'Kharægat' of the Scytho-Rus' Khaganate are our border vassals, vital forces in securing the hinterlands of the Khaganate from other hordes and dangerous separatists. Men from these regions are often led into the ranks of the Scytho-Rus' army due to their warrior cultures and strong will to defend."
 SCY_exploitation_of_the_slavs:0 "Exploitation of the Slavs"
 SCY_exploitation_of_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Slavic components of our Khaganate are instrumental to our economy. The steppes are wild and nomadic, whereas the forests of Eastern Europe provided the Scythians with an easy opportunity to usurp settled institutions established by the Kievan-Rus'. It is for this reason that most of the Khaganate's taxes come from Slavs."
 SCY_alim:0 "Khagan Alim Saurmag"
 SCY_alim_desc:0 "In the year 1468, the Khagan Alim Saurmag came to power. While his rule was tumultuous and filled with revolt, the country came out more enlightened than ever. Alim was a humanitarian and had controversial thoughts on religion, pushing through orders and edicts that saw the beginning of tolerance for the Khaganate's religious and ethnic minorities, something which was strongly opposed by Scythian and Turkic elites at the time. \n\nKhagan Alim would go down in history as the most influential ruler the Scytho-Rus' ever had."
 SCY_conquest_of_siberia:0 "Conquest of Sybirkhær"
 SCY_conquest_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia has always been a desire to many of our border settlers, notably for the lucrative fur trade found there. Cries for governmental action became stronger from Turkic components of the elite who wished to see the incorporation of their northern brethren into the Khaganate. There will never be a better time to sponsor the advance east."
 SCY_modernizing_an_empire:0 "Modernizing an Empire"
 SCY_modernizing_an_empire_desc:0 "This empire is one that stretches the borders of Europe and Asia, and as such is trapped between these worlds culturally and technologically. While in the past our proud Scythian heritage and nomadic tradition won victory in battle, it is clear that archers on horseback are not as effective as they used to be. With the armies of Europe conquering the world, it is time to adapt and embrace the West."
 SCY_expansion_of_liberties:0 "Expansion of Liberties"
 SCY_expansion_of_liberties_desc:0 "As the centuries wore on, the divide between the Khaganate's ethnic groups became to wear down, both through assimilation and acceptance. Notably, far greater autonomy was given to Slavic and Turkic components of the Empire, which began to form a more mutually beneficial arrangement for the Khaganate's elite and the groups that made it up."

So effective are they that their payment is their plunder, and their name is now used as an honorary title for those who help expand the borders of Islam. We would be wise to utilize these troops wherever possible."
 SLJ_the_mad_caliph:0 "The Mad Caliph"
 SLJ_the_mad_caliph_desc:0 "Beginning in 1468, the Caliph Ikram Al-e Seljuq II began a series of confrontations collectively known as the Seljuqid Mad Wars. They were largely aimless, sudden, and incredibly ambitious military operations that mostly ended with failure at the hands of the Akgulids, Musaids, Liao, and Anxyanao. These defeats came with a silver lining, however - the Caliphate had never before seen such levels of potential for expansion and heavy mobilization; the Mad Caliph reinvigorated a martial culture in the Empire."
 SLJ_the_caliphate:0 "The Caliphate"
 SLJ_the_caliphate_desc:0 "While for some years in our conquests the title of Caliph was contested, the death of the Abbasids in Cairo in 1364 and the creation of the Beylik of Egypt saw all rivals removed. From that day forward there would be only one Caliphate: the Seljuqids of Isfahan. \n\nThis title carries with it the weight of dynasties great and powerful, to join their ranks is an eternal honor."
 SLJ_global_navy:0 "The Navy of Islam"
 SLJ_global_navy_desc:0 "From the shores of Al-Andalus to Kalbid Italy, from the Red Sea to the Black, and from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Qarn Jadid, our fleets sail in the name of the Seljuqs and in the name of Allah.\n\nThe Fleet of Islam must grow if it is to secure Muslim trade and sovereignty around the globe."
 SLJ_expand_administration:0 "Expand the Administration"
 SLJ_expand_administration_desc:0 "The Caliphate is large, diverse, and unruly beast from a governmental perspective. While it is true that faith in Allah is enough to hold this Empire together, it wouldn't hurt to give Him some help.

 SLJ_lord_of_all_muslims:0 "Lord of All Muslims"
 SLJ_lord_of_all_muslims_desc:0 "As Caliph, our ruler is the Lord of All Muslims. \n\nThis truth shows itself in the rule over Mecca and Medina, in the cries for reinforcement that ring out of Iberia, in the wars waged against the Princely Confederation, and in the humble Quanzhou merchant who seeks our protection. Muhammad has never had a better shield."
 SLJ_birlik:0 "Birlik"
 SLJ_birlik_desc:0 "Our state is one built upon unity, not just untiy of Islam, but the unity of the Oghuz. Our elite is largely made up of Turks, Azeris, and Turkmens, all of close relation and cultural background. \n\nThe unity of the Oghuz will ensure loyalty in our realm evermore."

Its strategic position has allowed Aquitaine to take advantage of its surroundings and bring effective control in the region, becoming one of the largest realms in West Francia, with none other being as military oriented as Aquitaine."
 AQT_trade:0 "Pearls of the South"

 AQT_vassals:0 "Esteemed Reputation"
 AQT_vassals_desc:0 "After the fall of Charlemagne's empire, what is left behind is the shell of the legacy he left behind.

 AQT_technology:0 "Libertat Academica"
 AQT_technology_desc:0 "Aquitaine has always been a center of learning and culture, with much of the age of troubadours being centered on Bordeaux and has greatly benefited from influx of artists and scholars coming into the country. What makes Aquitaine different is its relatively lax policies and great funding for the arts and sciences in the country. Aquitaine charges on at the forefront of academic and scientific achievement."
 AQT_unrest:0 "Authority of the Crown"
 AQT_unrest_desc:0 "The kingdom cannot function without the support of the masses, but they often times have been sidelined from the goals of Aquitaine.

Thousands upon thousands of Oirat Mongol soldiers and horsemen poured into the region as to prepare for a campaign against the Scythians, but the defeat by the Liao and emergence of the Nogai fractured our empire before the Kalmyk campaign could begin. In the chaos, Mongols from Central Asia and Oirats from the homeland increasingly populated the eastern bank of the Volga, forming the periphery haven which has persisted to the modern day. \n\nAt the end of the day, we are just as much an heir to Genghis Khan as the pompous Yuan, and our army shows it."

 KMK_dorbet:0 "Dörbet"
 KMK_dorbet_desc:0 "Although our cultural composition is broadly Mongol, no group is a larger component than the Dörbet, a tribe of the Oirat. Whether it was for war or for refuge, the Kalmyk identity and culture is one largely influenced by the Dörbet settlers; we are a people who know migration."
 KMK_battle_of_samara:0 "Battle of Samara"
 KMK_battle_of_samara_desc:0 "The Battle of Samara in 1378 saw Kalmyk forces engage Scytho-Rus' defenders successfully at the river port. For decades there had been on-and-off hostilities across the Volga of little consequence, but the Kalmyk victory and high casualties sustained in it made both the Scythians and Kalmyks wary of further fighting. \n\nFrom that day forward, a period of peace and understanding would last evermore, slowly bringing the combatants into more friendly relation."

 KMK_buddhist_manuscripts_desc:0 "Our westward migration was not completely unorganized, in fact numerous items of value and cultural importance now reside within our borders.

 KMK_huurl:0 "Huurl"
 KMK_huurl_desc:0 "The Kalmyk Huurl is the meeting of elites that occurs in times of crisis to advise the current Khan or elect a new one.

 KMK_the_frontier:0 "The Frontier"
 KMK_the_frontier_desc:0 "In the Scytho-Rus' conquest of Siberia, the Kalmyks played a crucial role. As the (originally) easternmost subject of the Scythians, the Kalmyks were often the ones responsible for establishing the earliest settlements in the steppe and taiga. The Kalmyk cultural proximity to the Oirat and Buryats also acted to incentivize this arrangement through which a Mongolic equivalent to Slavic Cossacks was formed."

 BSH_fort_murtaza_desc:0 "Three times the Scythians tried to climb our mountains, and three times they were sent tumbling down. \n\nFort Murtaza sits in the Western Urals, and is a masterpiece of architecture. Lying at the entrance to many passes, it must be overtaken to safely cross into Bashkiria from the Volga Basin, and as such was a prime target for Scythian expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries. The numerous Bashkir victories stalled Scytho-Rus' expansion into Siberia and reinforced a proud identity for our people."

The stable nature of our khanate and its fierce yet respectable reputation makes the northern route one of the safest a caravan can take: one that is out of the hands of Nogai and Kazakh bandits."
 BSH_bashkir_khan:0 "The Bashkir Khan"
 BSH_bashkir_khan_desc:0 "The Bashkir Khan is far more powerful than any of the long gone Bulgar ones. Why? Because he is local! The Khan of the Bashkirs is an institution agreed upon by the four largest tribes of the Bülär, Yänäy, Meñ, and Äyle, who all swear loyalty upon the ascension of a new Khan."
 BSH_mountain:0 "Like a Mountain"
 BSH_mountain_desc:0 "It is in our military doctrine and in our folklore that one must be like a mountain. The Ural-Batyr, while not in agreement with Islam, is our national epic. It tells stories of a hero named Ural who fights demons, resists tyrannical khans, rides a winged steed, and encounters all sorts of beasts and legendary figures on his adventure to ultimately form the mountains for which he is named. \n\nWe should strive to be as strong as Ural and his mountains, for our future may very well be dictated by lessons of the past."

 BSH_tatar_mercenaries_desc:0 "While our relationship with the Kazani and Siberian Tatars is not always the most amicable, we are ultimately brothers, and family helps eachother in their time of need. Tatar mercenaries have a long history throughout Russia and the steppe, and Bashkiria is no exception. Within our borders they are treated well and fall in line seamlessly with our military. It is even better then that they are also highly effective."

 KRS_rebuild_desc:0 "In 1383, the Crimean Tatars under the leadership of Tokhtamysh raided into our city and destroyed it in its entirety. Soon afterwards, we appealed to the Lithuanians for protection, who happily sought retribution and conquered the khanate. Though the threat may be gone and decades have passed, the city still does not live up to its former glory. Let us rebuild a new Kursk, greater than ever before!"
 KRS_dva_kurska:0 "Dva Kurska"
 KRS_dva_kurska_desc:0 "The people of Kursk say that there are 'Dva Kurska' - 'Two Kursks' - that are presented to the world. The first is the eastern Kursk, presented to the Scytho-Rus' as a pragmatic ally who is willing to bend the rules where hostile Russians aren't. The second is the western Kursk, presented to the Poles and Lithuanians as a bastion of Christendom and a reliable ally on the frontier. By playing these two powers against eachother we have managed to maintain our independence where others have failed."
 KRS_vsevol:0 "Stepnov Damir Vsevol"
 KRS_vsevol_desc:0 "Among the great Rurikid military history, Stepnov Damir Vsevol reigns supreme. Gaining command over the army in 1479, Vsevol lead the regiments of Kursk against other Slavic polities while coordinating a heightened relationship with the Scythians. Siding with the eastern menace, the very nation which helped shatter our forebears, was not a popular decision, but one that the pragmatists in the military claimed needed to happen. \n\nDiplomatically there may be Two Kursks, but we have only one army."
 KRS_resist_ordo:0 "Resist the Ordo Incognita"
 KRS_resist_ordo_desc:0 "The actions of the increasingly pro-Scythian establishment attracted the ire of Christians across Europe, but especially the Catholic Poles and Lithuanians. A series of assassinations followed, notably against Stepnov Damir Vsevol, by the agents of the Ordo Incognita. This can not happen again, we much defend against their espionage proactively and reactively."
 KRS_all_must_serve:0 "All Must Serve"

We can rely on neither the Scytho-Rus' nor Poland to protect us in our times of need; Kursk must be self efficient. For such a small nation, we will need to punch above our weight, and we will need all to serve."
 KRS_death_to_vyatichi:0 "Death to the Vyatichi"
 KRS_death_to_vyatichi_desc:0 "The true traitors of Christendom and the Kievan Rus', the Vyatichi, are a scourge on Russia and Ruthenia. The tribe that refused to join, the tribe that embraced Islam, the tribe that invited the Scythians - their treacheries know no end. The Rurikid family can not rule in peace with the heirs of Vyatko scattered across the borderlands. Finally, we will bring the Vyatichi into the Ruthenian fold."
 KRS_patriarch_of_kursk:0 "Patriarch of Kursk"
 KRS_patriarch_of_kursk_desc:0 "The Patriarch of Kursk is one of few in Orthodoxy who refuse the status of the Patriarch of Constantinople as a 'First Among Equals' in the faith. Shall we have a Pope like the Catholics? The very notion is absurd, and the people of Kursk agree that in our lands only our church may reign and make decrees."

While the Cumans were defeated and sought refuge in Europe, the Nogai Horde defeated the local Oirat bands and forced the Mongol Dogs of War back to the east and towards Samara.

From the Volga to Balkhash, the Nogai banner is flown just as the Kipchak once was."

The Manghud (later known as the Turkic Manghit) are a bizarre group of Central Asian Mongols who historically were opposed to the rule of Genghis, and later, the rule of Jochi. They were those who led the Nogai and Cumans into their successful revolt, and continued to rule the Khanate well into the 16th century."
 NOG_slave_raids:0 "Slave Raids"
 NOG_slave_raids_desc:0 "The Nogai are infamous raiders of the steppe, and amongst their most trafficked goods are people. \n\nThe slave raids of the Nogai, once practiced as far west as Crimea, remain a major source of revenue for the state. The danger of trafficking the most dangerous game has made our horseman experts of swift pillaging."
 NOG_ulus:0 "Ulus"
 NOG_ulus_desc:0 "While not every Ulus ever made in Mongolic administrative tradition is looked on fondly, the ones in Nogai are to be envied. In our Khanate, an Ulus is a subdivision made up of many families, often analagous to the military unit of a Tumen. The leaders of each Ulus are thought to be the most capable generals in the Khanate, and their autonomy in raids and defense provide free training for the warfare of the steppe."
 NOG_emir:0 "Emir of the Steppes"
 NOG_emir_desc:0 "'We may be Mongols, but we are not Genghisids!' \n\nThe Nogai Khan, while an appropriate title, is not technically a Khan - he is an Emir. The Emir of the Steppes is a title taken as to derive the right to rule from Allah and not from blood. The Manghud elite took this title as a result of their swift conversion to Islam from Tengrism and a negative view of The Great Khan and his descendents. This religious legacy persists to this day."

In exchange for our protection from other hordes, the Yaik Peasants pay high tax to Khan and constitute an important part of our nation."

 KHZ_chagan_bulan_desc:0 "In the 700s, Chaghan Bulan led our nation to convert to Judaism. What was originally a phenomenon restricted to the Khazar elite trinkled down to the subjects of the Khaganate as years passed and the old ways were forgotten. In the year 1415 our nation is the only Jewish one on the Eurasian landmass, and as such we have two heritages to protect: the triumph of the Gökturks and the legend of Israel."
 KHZ_diarchy:0 "Khazar Diarchy"
 KHZ_diarchy_desc:0 "Our state is a diarchy, an ancestral form of government in the steppe. Our higher leader is the 'Chaghan,' a spiritual and dynastic figure who holds the nation together religiously and culturally. Our lower leader is the 'Bek,' an influential individual who manages the day to day affairs of the Khanate. The Bek is often the more central administrator and conqueror, usually being selected as a general of great merit."
 KHZ_arsiyah:0 "The Long Revolt"
 KHZ_arsiyah_desc:0 "To our north lies the Long Revolt. \n\nFollowing the initial conquest of Scythia, soldiers were frequently recruited into the Chaghan's army and personal guard from their warrior society. The largest denomination of Scythian successors, the Arsiyah, formed the core of this mercenary force and began to frequently disobey Khazar orders, operating autonomously oncemore. They revolted in the north centuries ago, and the Khazars still refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the empire the Arsiyah have made. It's okay though, we're stronger without relying on them."
 KHZ_seven_judges:0 "Seven Judges of Atil"
 KHZ_seven_judges_desc:0 "The Seven Judges of Atil, still called so despite the loss of the city, are the highest judicial authorities in our land. Established during our Khanate's prime by the Jewish Chaghans, the judges act to solve legal and trade disputes that are beneath the diarchs. As to ensure religious fairness, two judges are Jewish, two are Christian, two are Muslim, and another is Pagan (typically Tengrist, Khabzeist, or Vainakh). Their authority is seen as balanced and just, pacifying the peoples of our lands."
 KHZ_great_standing_army:0 "Great Standing Army"

 KHZ_tuduns:0 "Benevolent Tuduns"
 KHZ_tuduns_desc:0 "The Khazar realm is locally managed by 'Tuduns,' the governors of the steppe and Caucasus.
