 papal_fief_long_desc: "A Papal Fief is free in its diplomacy and is essentially independent from the Papacy. The Papacy is not called to a fief's war. It cannot be annexed and if it is either a theocracy, at war with a Crusade Target, the overlord gains a military related modifier. The fief pays very little to the Pope, but in exchange the fief gains a bonus to tax income, diplomatic reputation and devotion. A Papal Sanctuary itself gains a bonus to tax income, legitimacy equivalent, yearly papal influence and religious unity.\n"
