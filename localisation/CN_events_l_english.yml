 austria_succession.1.title:0 "A Looming Crisis"
 austria_succession.1.desc:0 "Just as the fast as the unification of the realms began, it fell twice as fast. Nearly torn to shreds, Austria has barely held on as the vanguard to the east. Through diplomatic settlement we have had a period of peace and it looked as if stability would return. Alas not all things could go well, as family turned on one another with their schemes, and what was once a bulward against the enemy, Austria fractured, and its lands divided. \n\nEnemies within and without, what does this say for the fate of the archduchy? Moving ahead, Austria lies in peril."
 austria_succession.1.a:0 "May god lead us through this calamity."
 austria_succession.2.title:0 "Austrian Question"
 austria_succession.2.desc:0 "Ever since the end of Premysl Otakar II's reign, Austria has fallen from the purview of our crown. The Habsburgs have risen since and have been growing in power and we have been reduced to a backdrop in the internal affairs of the Empire. Humliation and decline soon followed and it seemed like the Habsburgs would become the dominant power. But Bohemia had been able to resurface under the House of Luxemburg. \n\nNow, Austria lies in a succession crisis. The family bickering with one another has caused a dynastic crisis over the fate of Austria and has severely hampered their power as a result. Now with the fall of the Habsburg hegemony, Austria is in a weaker position, and it would be wise to take note of the varying circumstances to the south. This chaos boasts an opportunity to restore the height of Bohemia and to destroy the rotten swines once and for all."
 austria_succession.2.a:0 "We will watch closely."
 austria_succession.3.title:0 "An Opportune Moment"
 austria_succession.3.desc:0 "The foolish Germans to the north have always sought to expand their influence throughout the Po Valley. The most egregious act was the invasion of our eastern domains in 1390. We had just established the presence of Viscounti rule, but these lands had become rebellious, and under the guise of intervening, the Habsburgs swept up from the Alps and seized Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and Brescia from our grasp. Their reign of terror hasn't ended and they even took the neighbouring city of Mantua. Now the tables have turned in our favor. The Habsburgs are more divided than ever and their position wholly weakened. It is up to us to make haste and take back what is rightfully ours."
 austria_succession.3.a:0 "We will expel the Germans from all of Italy!"
 austria_succession.4.title:0 "Sidelined No More"
 austria_succession.4.desc:0 "The dynastic lords in Styria have always held the position of their rightful succession to the throne, but what right is there for them to have it? They have only served to protect their own while local lords had to fend for themselves while coveting the emperorship for their own gain. The pompous Styrians have always sidelined other branches of the family and relegated them to farfling crownlands in an attempt to build his powerbase. This has caused great strife for those living outside of direct Styrian control, and much discontent. \n\nThere are rumours of Ernest's poor health and his poor statesmanship recently has supported this theory. It would... be a shame if something were to happen to him, wouldn't it?"
 austria_succession.4.a:0 "It would."
 austria_succession.5.title:0 "Truth of the Matter"
 austria_succession.5.desc:0 "Even more distant than the crownlands of Austria, Trent was a protected county of Austria, given special previleges and even land in return for servititude to Austria. And yet, when we called on our masters to help us against the Great Verona Revolt, they refused to give us any support! It was by a miracle we were able to survive and not alarm our neighbors of our weak position. But now we saw the true face of the Austrians. They do not care about us and thus we should not care for them. We are on our own and we must defend ourselves without them. This is easy to say, harder to execute though. Should we break free without any provisions... well, let's say that the Milanese would be happy to welcome us."
