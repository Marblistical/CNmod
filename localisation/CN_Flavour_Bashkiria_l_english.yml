The Khanty and Mansi request that we bestow the lands in which their people live to the Chiefdom of Khantia-Mansia.

 bsh_flavor.2.title:0 "The League of Tartary"
 bsh_flavor.2.desc:0 "To our west lies the Scytho-Rus' Khaganate, a formidable force that has expanded north in recent times and undoubtedly has aspirations to subjugate us. There have been two proposals from our four tribes, one of defense and one of offense. One suggestion posits that we focus on diplomatically uniting the other Kipchak polities which border us and forcibly incorporating those who resist, that way we will be ready to face the Scythians when the time comes. On the other hand, we could quickly rush down our neighbors and sabotage the Scythian vassal system, depriving them of power until we emerge ready to overrun Scythia. So, Bashkir khan, what do we do?"

 bsh_flavor.3.a:0 "Together, who could possibly stop us?"
 bsh_flavor.3.b:0 "We do not bow to the khan in $FROMCOUNTRY$!"
