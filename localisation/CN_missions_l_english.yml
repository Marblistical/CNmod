 nog_fourth_capital_title:0 "The Fourth Capital"
 nog_fourth_capital_desc:0 "The current Nogai capital of Saray-Juk is the fourth for the horde elite in the steppe, with the Manghud having followed the Mongol leadership from Syghnak to Sarai to Agyidel. We should develop this new capital to as acceptable a condition as the previous three, and maybe reaffirm or deny its legitimacy in bearing such an honor."
 nog_steppe_wealth_title:0 "Wealth of the Steppe"
 nog_steppe_wealth_desc:0 "While at first glance the steppe seems barren and distraught, there is opportunity to be made here. Riches flow from east to west and west to east, the non-nomadic provide ample opportunties for plunder, and we have some native goods to speak of. If we start to stuff our coffers then it is likely more wealth will follow."
 nog_proclaim_ambition_title:0 "Proclaim Our Ambition"
 nog_proclaim_ambition_desc:0 "For decades has the Nogai Horde lied relatively passive. The end of the revolt against the western Mongols also signified the end of conquest, as petty border raids and wars of little significance depleted the prestige of the region - our nation included. It is time for the Nogai to proclaim their ambition, to proclaim that glorious days lie ahead!"
 nog_prove_might_title:0 "Prove Our Might"
 nog_prove_might_desc:0 "It is not enough that we simply flex our muscles - we must use them. The time has come for Nogai armies and bands to sprawl across the great steppe and display our absolute power to our enemies."
 nog_prepare_title:0 "Prepare for Conquest"
 nog_prepare_desc:0 "No conquest is done without an army, and the vast steppe before us requires an appropriately vast army. Let us build up as strong a force as we can muster and prepare for conquest."
 nog_subjugate_kazakhs_title:0 "Subjugate the Kazakhs"
 nog_subjugate_kazakhs_desc:0 "The Kazakh Khanate is largely defeated, governing a minority of Kazakhs in Central Asia. Within our borders is a large amount of that population, ready to be unified with their eastern kin, under a Nogai Khan, of course. It would be wise to tie this loose end before marching onwards."
 nog_subjugate_bashkirs_title:0 "Subjugate the Bashkirs"
 nog_subjugate_bashkirs_desc:0 "The Bashkirs that have established a nation to our north have no such right. Prior to the Mongol invasions, they were governed by the Bulgars and the other steppe polities. If we wish to be as great as our predecessors then Bashkiria must perish."
 nog_capture_astrakhan_title:0 "Capture of Astrakhan"
 nog_capture_astrakhan_desc:0 "The capture of Astrakhan is one of the most important events facing our horde. The Volga city is the gateway to the Pontic Steppe, to Caucasia, and even partly into Scythia. Such a strategically, culturally, and economically important city has only one rightful ruler: The Firstborn Kipchak."
 nog_subjugate_sibirs_title:0 "Subjugate the Siberian Tatars"
 nog_subjugate_sibirs_desc:0 "The Khanate on the Edge of the World, that's what people call it. Although the Tatars of Sibir have established their own state, they have a weak history. The region has been subservient to more southerly steppe powers since records began, and this time will be no exception. If the Genghisids can conquer them, so can we!"
 nog_northern_route_title:0 "The Northern Route"
 nog_northern_route_desc:0 "The northern route of the Volga branch of the silk and fur trade passes, importantly, through Kazan. This Tatar city will be a great boon for our empire in controlling trade and in war, as the Kazani Tatars are known to be some of the most formidable mercenaries in the steppe. We must have this city."
 nog_left_bank_title:0 "Left Bank of the Volga"
 nog_left_bank_desc:0 "The influence of the Scytho-Rus' has historically shifted, crossing the Volga numerous times just to retreat again. There is not enough room for a Scythian heavyweight in Central Asia alongside us. If the Nogai wish for wealth and land, then the Scythians must not be allowed either. Guard the Volga! Throw the Scythians back, and make sure they don't cross again!"
 nog_scythian_menace_title:0 "The Scythian Menace"
 nog_scythian_menace_desc:0 "We've guarded the Volga, and we've only grown stronger. It is time to secure the western steppe! The Nogai will march on Scythia!"
 nog_service_title:0 "In Service of the Crimeans"
 nog_service_desc:0 "Entering the Pontic Steppe has reminded us of old ties in the west. The Crimean Khanate, vanquished by the Lithuanians many moons ago, yearns to join their relatives in the Firstborn Kipchaks. Let us start the trek towards reclaiming Crimea!"
 nog_crimean_conquest_title:0 "Crimean Conquest"
 nog_crimean_conquest_desc:0 "The Nogai have historically had a prescence in Crimea, acting as frequent border raiders between the Tatar and Slavic lands. With the fall of the Cuman-Kipchaks this arrangement came to an end and the Tatars were largely left to their own devices. We must march west oncemore, and proclaim suzerainty over the Crimeans."
 nog_rule_through_islam_title:0 "Rule Through Islam"
 nog_rule_through_islam_desc:0 "While many states in the steppe - even those Kipchak - trace their origin ultimately to Genghis Khan, the Manghud Ediguids do no such thing. The Manghud represent those Mongols who resist Genghis' claims of greatness and have embraced the local Turks they rule over. As a result, these Manghud Khans bear the title of Emir as well in order to legitimize their reign through the Sunni Muslim faith."
 nog_legacy_title:0 "A Manghud Legacy"
 nog_legacy_desc:0 "The Nogai are ruled by the Manghud band of Turkicized Mongols. These Central Asian offshoots of Kiyat Mongols have no formed their own identity, culture, and legacy to uphold. Perhaps no cultural center is more important than the historical Manghud capital of Syghnak. Let us have it oncemore."
 nog_increased_raids_title:0 "Increased Border Raids"
 nog_increased_raids_desc:0 "We have historically sought out raids against our wealthy neighbors, in particular the Great Liao who reign along the Syr and Amu Daryas. Petty thievery on the border won't cut it anymore, we must seize control of their goods entirely!"
 nog_old_habits_title:0 "Old Habits"
 nog_old_habits_desc:0 "We Nogai have a reputation from our old habits. There exists a dichotomy, that of the barbarian raider and that of the enlightened Emir of the Steppes. Let us lean towards glory, and be ever-prestigious!"
 nog_warchest_title:0 "A Nogai War Chest"
 nog_warchest_desc:0 "Conquest costs more than men and determination, it costs money. The Nogai State has great ambitions, but if it wishes to achieve them then a war chest is in order. Soon, we will turn gold into blood."
 nog_jochids_title:0 "Destroy the Jochids"
 nog_jochids_desc:0 "The final vestiges of the once great Ulus of Jochi lie dying in the year 1415. As decades wear on, their death simply seems more assured. Let us ensure these dogs are put down for good; may no trace of the western Mongols be spared from destruction."

NOG_crimea:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains claims on every province of §YCrimean§! Culture in the §YPontic Steppe§! Region."
NOG_crimea_conquest_culture:0 "§Y[2411.GetName]§! and all other provinces of §YCrimean§! Culture in the §YPontic Steppe§! Region: \nOwned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its non-Tributary Subjects."

 bsh_tatar_brotherhood_title:0 "Tatar Brotherhood"
 bsh_tatar_brotherhood_desc:0 "Across the Urals span three noble peoples, the Tatars of Kazan, the Bashkirs, and the Tatars of Sibir. Although not entirely united, the Bashkir Khanate in 1415 is the closest to bring this Tatar triad together. To claim rulership over all three, we must first possess a land that each considers their own."
 bsh_northern_shield_title:0 "Northern Shield"
 bsh_northern_shield_desc:0 "The outermost extent of Islam makes itelf known from Kazan to Tyumen. Along these areas a northern shield is made, a shield which must be used to push. Armed with religious conviction and the northern jewel of Kazan, relations both theological and mercantile will be forged in the boreal forests."
 bsh_fur_wars_title:0 "Fur Wars"
 bsh_fur_wars_desc:0 "In the dense Taiga there is plenty of game, a valuable resource in our region's trade. However, control over this resource is contested. To profit the most from the furs of Siberia, we ought to bring the best hunting lands under our sway."
 bsh_ostyaks_title:0 "Form Ostyak Relations"
 bsh_ostyaks_desc:0 "Victory in the Fur Wars has brought us into contact with other experienced hunters, the Khanty and Mansi of Yugra. They seem relatively backwards and lack any complex political and social systems, but they are good at what they do. We should encourage the incorporation of these peoples into our Khanate, as they will be instrumental in our quest to develop the steppe."
 bsh_found_khantia_title:0 "Found Khantia-Mansia"
 bsh_found_khantia_desc:0 "The uncivilized peoples of Yugra are largely reliant on us for their export. Although they retain a simple tribal system, the mixing of Bashkir traders into their society has given rise to numerous influential families in the region. Perhaps, a loyal Khanty-Mansi state under the control of a Bashkir chief could be formed."
 bsh_diplomacy_title:0 "Bashkir Diplomacy"
 bsh_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Bashkirs have a long diplomatic tradition, dating back to their negotiations with Jochid leadership of the Mongol Empire and the unification of the tribes. Throughout the ensuing centuries, we have learned that it can often be advantageous to make peace rather than war."
 bsh_to_be_bashkir_title:0 "What It Means To Be Bashkir"
 bsh_to_be_bashkir_desc:0 "There are many things that set the Bashkirs apart from their other Kipchak neighbors. However, these cultural traits don't always agree. Are we defined by our drive for a powerful khanate, after being denied one of our own for so long, or are we defined by our cool heads and silver tongues? Are we defined by the national epics and tales we tell in these mountains, or are we defined by our allegiance to Islam? The list goes on, and it is time to decide."
 bsh_defenses_title:0 "Defenses of Murtaza"
 bsh_defenses_desc:0 "The great Fort Murtaza has certainly seen better days. Let us renovate it so we may strike down its attackers when the time is right."
 bsh_fortress_bashkiria_title:0 "Fortress Bashkiria"
 bsh_fortress_bashkiria_desc:0 "We are beset by threats to our independence, notably the Scythians and a potential resurgent Yuan. If Bashkiria is to survive these uncertain times, we must make it into a fortress!"
 bsh_nogai_title:0 "Lord of Nogais"
 bsh_nogai_desc:0 "In the year 1415, the Nogai Khans rule from their treasonous seat of power in Saraichik. Of importance to them are the historical Manghud capitals, notably, the Bashkir lands of Agyidel! The 'winter capital' of Jochi is our birthright, not theirs! And why stop there? Why just rule Agyidel when we could be the Lord of the Nogais absolutely!"
 bsh_astrakhan_title:0 "Lord of Astrakhanis"
 bsh_astrakhan_desc:0 "The Tatars of Astrakhan are not so different from us, and importantly, their territory is vital to the Volga trade. If we wish to keep the trade routes open and prosperous, the conquest of Astrakhan is one of the best ways to ensure it!"
 bsh_kazakh_title:0 "Lord of Kazakhs"
 bsh_kazakh_desc:0 "The Kazakh Khanate is a sorry state, there is no denying it. Years of defeat at the hands of Nogai, Sibir, and Oirat have taken their toll on the land. Under our protection, Kazakhstan can oncemore be a respectable part of the Kipchak homeland and eternal steppe."
 bsh_kyrgyz_title:0 "Lord of Kyrgyz"
 bsh_kyrgyz_desc:0 "The Kyrgyz haven't had a state of their own ever since the collapse of the Kemek Confederation. Their homeland was conquered by migrating Oirats, and others still fled south to the Liao. Does it not make sense for them to be ruled by their fellow Turk over despotic Mongols and the incompetent empire-in-exile?"
 bsh_undying_title:0 "The Undying Khanate"
 bsh_undying_desc:0 "While the powers that used to exist around us had historical precedent, the Bashkir Khanate never did! We have forged our own glory and gathered our own power, so the underdog khanate emerges victorious. With honors under our belt and a young empire ahead of us, let the undying khanate be proclaimed!"
 bsh_bashgird_title:0 "The Bashgird Gold Mine"
 bsh_bashgird_desc:0 "We're lucky to control one of the only profitable mines in Central Asia, and it's full of gold! We should foster its development and fill our coffers accordingly."
 bsh_wealth_title:0 "Bashkir Wealth"
 bsh_wealth_desc:0 "Is it any wonder that our honorable khanate receives such trade and other forms of income? Only good things can come from a wealthy Bashkiria!"

Only together can we manage to extinguish the Arsiyah flame before it engulfs us entirely!
